D. Summary Judgment Motions in Foreclosure Cases
i. Prerequisites to Scheduling Hearing
Prior to selecting a mortgage foreclosure summary judgment hearing date on
the JAWS, attorneys of record for plaintiffs must file with the clerk the motion for
summary judgment and a uniform affidavit titled "Affidavit of Compliance with
Foreclosure Procedures." The uniform affidavit form may be accessed at
www.f1 ju dl3 .org. The affidavit swears or affirms that certain requisite actions have
been completed and the dates on which they have occurred. Hearings scheduled on
the JAWS prior to the filing of the summary judgment motion and the affidavit may
be cancelled by the court without notice.
ii. Original Note or Lost Instrument Affidavit Required
If an affidavit of lost instrument is filed with the clerk, the affidavit must
contain an agreement to indemnify the maker(s) or provide other adequate
consideration. See§ 673.3091 (2), Fla. Stat. ("The court may not enter judgment in
favor of the person seeking enforcement unless it finds that the person required to pay
the instrument is adequately protected."); see also § 702.11, Fla. Stat. (establishing
reasonable means of adequate protection). These requirements are in addition to the
pleading procedures set forth in section 702.015, Florida Statutes.
11. Hearings
A. Scheduling
Attorneys may obtain available hearing times and schedule hearings on a
judge ' s calendar by telephoning or e-mailing the judge's judicial assistant or
accessing the JAWS. In foreclosure cases pending in Division "M," attorneys must
set hearings in Section I or II on the JAWS. Self-represented parties may identify
available hearing times and schedule hearings on a judge's calendar by telephoning or
e-mailing the judge's judicial assistant. In foreclosure cases pending in Division "M,"
self-represented parties may schedule hearings by contacting the case manager in
Section I at sectionlrmf@fljud13.org or Section II at sectionllrmf@fljud13.org. The
court may unilaterally cancel without notice any hearing set on the JAWS if the court
has already entered an order on a non-evidentiary motion.
B. Telephonic
Telephonic hearings are governed by Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.451 and
Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.530. For any multi-party telephonic hearings,
all parties must be conferenced into the call prior to the call being placed to the
presiding judge's office or courtroom. For any foreclosure case pending in Division
"M," attorneys must use CourtCall (http: //www.courtcall.com) or another comparable
telephonic court appearance program for all telephonic appearances for summary
judgment motions and other motion hearings.
Page 10 of 19 - Administrative Order S-2017-070 (Circuit Civil Division)
C. Notice of Hearing
All notices of hearing must state the length of the time reserved on the judge's
calendar for the hearing or must state that the hearing is on the Uniform Motion
Calendar and must specify which matters are being heard. The court finds it helpful if
the notice of hearing also specifies the date that the motion was filed. Counsel and self-
represented parties are not authorized to indicate that the hearing will be on "all
pending motions;" rather, the matter(s) being heard must be set out with particularity.
There will be no cross-noticing on hearing time unless the opposing counsel or
opposing party contacts the judge's office and determines if the docket will
accommodate hearing additional matters at the same time.
D. Cancellation
If any hearing is canceled or rescheduled, the attorney or self-represented party
setting the hearing must notify the judge's judicial assistant and the opposing counsel or
opposing party as soon as possible of the cancellation. If the hearing was scheduled on
JAWS, attorneys must also cancel the hearing through JAWS. In foreclosure cases,
cancellations less than 20 days before the hearing date require a written notice of
cancellation filed with an explanation of the reason for the cancellation.
E. Uniform Motion Calendar
i. Availability
Each standard civil division will, and any specialty civil division may, maintain a
Uniform Motion Calendar on a regular basis. Each attorney setting any appropriate
motion for hearing on the Uniform Motion Calendar must ascertain the presiding
judge's availability prior to serving notice.
ii. Time Limitation
Hearings are limited to 10 minutes per case with time to be allocated to the
parties by the judge. The IO minutes includes the time necessary for the judge to review
documents, memoranda, and cases.
111. Types of Matters
Parties and counsel may only schedule matters on the Uniform Motion Calendar
if they can be heard within 10 minutes. The court will not hear contempt matters and
testimonial matters on the Uniform Motion Calendar. Procedural matters will not be
heard unless counsel for the moving party files a certification with the motion in
accordance with section 10.A. of this administrative order.
iv. Complexity
At the hearing, the judge may order that a further hearing be scheduled if the
matter appears too complex to handle on the Uniform Motion Calendar.
Page 11 of 19 - Administrative Order S-2017-070 ( Circuit Civil Division)
12. Orders
Except when the court enters a Unifonn Final Judgment of Foreclosure (as
referenced in section 5.B. of this administrative order), the following provisions apply
to orders after a hearing:
A. Consultation with Opposing Counsel or Opposing Self-
Represented Party
Unless the presiding judge directs otherwise, prior to submitting a proposed
order for the court's consideration after a hearing, the counsel or self-represented
party directed to submit the proposed order must consult with opposing counsel or the
opposing self-represented party within three business days after the court's decision
and make a genuine effort to agree on the language of the proposed order.
B. Cover Letter
Prior to submitting a cover letter with a stipulated proposed order, the attorney
must review and comply with the internal division procedures posted on the presiding
judge ' s webpage to detennine that judge's preference on the use of cover letters for
stipulated proposed orders.
C. Timely Submission
Proposed orders on motions scheduled on the Uniform Motion Calendar must
be submitted to the judge within three days of the judge's ruling. Unless the presiding
judge directs otherwise, proposed orders on all other motions must be submitted to
the judge by the attorney or self-represented party directed to prepare the order within
IO business days after the judge' s ruling. If the attorney or self-represented party
designated to prepare the order fails to timely submit a proposed order, the attorney
for the opposing party or the opposing self-represented party may submit a proposed
order within five business days after the initial time period.
D. Submission of Proposed Orders and Judgments
i. JAWS - All Parties Represented by Counsel
Unless the presiding judge directs otherwise, if all parties are represented by
attorneys, none of whom have been excused from e-mail service under Florida Rule
of Judicial Administration 2.516, an attorney who is requested to submit a proposed
order must do so through the JAWS. Prior to submitting a proposed order, the
attorney must review and comply with the internal division procedures posted on the
presiding judge's webpage to detennine that judge's fonnat preference (Microsoft
Word v. searchable PDF). If the presiding judge does not have divisional provisions
posted, then the attorney should submit the proposed order in searchable PDF.
Page 12 of 19 - Administrative Order S-2017-070 ( Circuit Civil Division)
ii. Hard Copies and Envelopes - Self-Represented Party,
Party' s Attorney Excused from E-Service or Presiding
Judge's Direction
If any party is self-represented or represented by an attorney who has been
excused from e-mail service by the court under Rule 2.516 or if the presiding jud ge
directs, the self-represented party or attorney who is requested to submit a proposed
order or judgment must do so by submitting to the presiding judge sufficient hard
copies of the proposed order or judgment along with stamped, addressed envelopes.
E. Title
The title of every proposed order submitted must contain the subject matter of
the pleading or motion upon which the ruling is made and must fairly apprise the
reader of the action being ordered. Phrasing such as "order granting . .. " or "order
denying ... " is preferred over "order on ... ".
F. Form
The first paragraph of all proposed orders must state the date or dates on which
the hearing or trial took place. In all proposed orders, the page containing the court' s
signature must also contain substantive language of the proposed order so that a
proposed order does not contain a signature page consisting only of the court's
signature. Each page, except for the first page, must contain a page number.
13. Orders of Disbursement from the Court Registry
A. Request for Clerk's Statement of Available Registry Funds
At any time a party seeks an order directing the clerk to disburse funds from
the court registry, prior to filing a motion, the party must request the clerk to provide
a statement showing available funds in the court registry. The statement will indicate
the date and time the available funds were verified by the clerk. The clerk will
develop and post on the clerk' s website (www.hillsclerk.com) a form entitled Request
for Clerk's Statement of Available Registry Funds.
B. Motion for Disbursement of Registry Funds
The party must attach a copy of the clerk's Statement of Available Registry
Funds to the motion for disbursement of funds, file and serve the motion on all parties
and legal counsel for the clerk. If the party seeking disbursement objects to the
amount listed in the clerk's Statement of Available Registry Funds, the motion must
identify the basis for the objection, and set the motion for hearing. If the party
seeking disbursement does not object to the amount listed in the clerk' s Statement of
Available Registry Funds, the motion must confirm the stated amount is the proper
amount of disbursement and request the entry of an order, without a hearing, if no
other party files and serves a written objection within five days after service of the
Page 13 of 19 - Administrative Order S-2017-070 (Circuit Civil Division)
motion.
C. Change in Registry Balance
If any party becomes aware of any change to the court registry balance after the
issuance of the initial clerk's Statement of Available Registry Funds, that party must
obtain an updated clerk's Statement of Available Registry Funds and provide copies
to the other party and to the court prior to the hearing on the motion seeking
disbursement. If an updated clerk's Statement of Available Registry Funds is not
presented at the hearing on the motion seeking disbursement, then the amount
identified in the initial clerk's Statement of Available Registry Funds will be deemed
the correct amount available for disbursement.
D. Disbursement Orders to Account for Clerk Fees
All proposed orders submitted to the court for disbursement from the court
registry must contain the phrase "less clerk fees" immediately after the total requested
disbursement amount (for example, Total: $12,000, less clerk fees). If the amount in
the order exceeds the amount held in the court registry, the clerk will disburse the
available amount in the registry, less clerk fees, at the time of the entry of the order
(pro rata if disbursement is made to multiple parties).
14. Final Judgments
All final judgments must state in the title whether they are entered against
plaintiff(s) or defendant(s). Any final judgment which is not against all plaintiffs or all
defendants named in the action will additionally state the name of each party against
whom judgment is rendered. For example, a final judgment against all defendants in an
action will be titled "Final Judgment against Defendants." A final judgment against
only one of two named defendants in an action will be titled "Final Judgment against
Defendant, John Doe."
15. Jury Trials
A. Trial Division 1
Multi-week cases may be scheduled in Trial Division 1 as set forth below. If the
presiding judge of a standard division has conferred with the presiding judge of Trial
Division 1 and determined that the schedule in Trial Division 1 may accommodate the
trial, the presiding judge in Trial Division 1 will enter an order setting case for pretrial
and trial. All pretrial motions will be heard in the standard divisions and even after a
case is set for pretrial and trial in Trial Division 1, no pretrial motions will be heard in
Trial Division 1.
Page 14 of 19 - Administrative Order S-2017-070 (Circuit Civil Division)
B. Standard Divisions
The judge of each standard division will schedule the weeks in which jury trials
will be held in that division and will determine the number of cases to be set for trial in
any given week. The judge will determine the order to be assigned to each case
scheduled for trial in that judge's division.
C. Uniform Order
Uniform orders setting pre-trial and trial for jury cases must be used. Uniform
orders can be found at www.fljudl3 .org.
16. Exhibits
A. Generally
Each exhibit must be identified numerically, starting with number l. Each exhibit
must be preceded by a cover sheet indicating the exhibit number and the party
submitting the exhibit. All exhibits must be listed, in numerical order, on a separate
paper that sets forth the case caption, identifies the party submitting the exhibits and
includes columns with the following headings: Exhibit Number, Document Description,
Date Identified, Date Admitted, and With or Without Objection. No markings should be
made in the "Identified" and "Admitted" columns. These columns are to be used by the
courtroom clerk to record the exhibits that are offered into evidence and those that are
received into evidence. Each party must provide a paper copy of the Exhibit List to the
courtroom clerk before the start of the evidentiary hearing or trial. The courtroom clerk
will file the completed Exhibit List after the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing or
trial.
B. Format {Electronic or Paper)
Unless the presiding judge directs otherwise, parties represented by counsel must
file electronically-stored exhibits, except that paper exhibits may be used in all cases in
which any party is self-represented.
C. Electronically-Stored Exhibits
1. Format
Each numbered and marked exhibit must include an Exhibit Cover Sheet and be
electronically stored in an individual Portable Document Format (PDF) file. Each PDF
file must have a unique identification name and number (e.g. Plaintiffs Exhibit I).
a. Fifty Megabytes or Less
If the number of exhibits listed on a party's Exhibit List are 50 megabytes or less,
the party submitting the exhibits must e-file them with the Exhibit List as a separate
attachment to a filing titled "Notice of Filing [Party' s Name]'s Exhibit List for [Trial or
Evidentiary Hearing]. Thee-filing of the Exhibit List and exhibits via the E-Portal will
Page 15 of 19 - Administrative Order S-2017-070 ( Circuit Civil Division)
effectuate a party's delivery of exhibits to the opposing party or parties.
b. More than 50 Megabytes
If the number of exhibits listed on a party's Exhibit List are in excess of 50
megabytes, the exhibits must be stored on a Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash drive or
compact disc (CD) in a file named with the case name, case number, and the party
introducing the exhibits (e.g. Smith v. Jones, 14-CA-123456, Plaintiffs Exhibits for
[Trial or Evidentiary Hearing]. Parties may exchange exhibits by delivering a CD or
USB flash drive containing the exhibits to the opposing party or parties by the time set
forth in the court's pretrial order for exchange of exhibits. A CD or USB flash drive
containing the Exhibit List and the electronically stored exhibits must be delivered to
the courtroom clerk before the start of the trial or evidentiary hearing.
ii. Use in Court
The electronically-stored exhibits will be considered the official exhibits for
purposes of trial or the evidentiary hearing. However, a party using exhibits during the
examination of a witness must, at the commencement of the party' s questioning of the
witness, provide paper copies of the exhibits to be used during the examination of the
witness to the court, the witness, and other parties. Paper exhibits used during the
examination of a witness will be removed from the courtroom following their use by the
party using the paper exhibits.
m. Additional Exhibits
If additional exhibits are offered or introduced during tlie course of the
evidentiary hearing or trial that were not either e-filed or included on the USB flash
drive or CD furnished to the courtroom clerk, a complete set of the additional exhibits
introduced into evidence must bee-filed as separate attachments to a filing titled
"Notice of Filing [Party's Name]'s Additional Exhibits" within seven days following
the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing or trial.
D. Paper Exhibits
i. Submitting Exhibits to the Court
At the commencement of an evidentiary hearing or trial, each party must deliver
to the courtroom clerk the original and one copy of the Exhibit List and all exhibits to
be introduced into evidence in paper format. Original exhibits must not be stapled or
permanently bound. Additional copies of the exhibits, either stapled or in binders or
folders must be provided for use by witnesses, opposing counsel or party, and the
presiding judge . Any exhibits introduced at hearing or trial that have not been pre-
marked should be tendered to and marked by the courtroom clerk as they are presented
in evidence.
Page 16 of 19 - Administrative Order S-2017-070 (Circuit Civil Division)
ii. Large Items or Non-Paper Exhibits
Items other than paper documents to be introduced into evidence must be
photographed, accompanied by an Exhibit Cover Sheet, and listed on the Exhibit List.
Paper documents larger than 8½ x 11 inches must be listed on the Exhibit List and
accompanied by a reduced 8½ x I I-inch copy and an Exhibit Cover Sheet. Counsel
must attach Exhibit Cover Sheets to both the original physical exhibit and the
photograph or reduced copy of the exhibit (substitutes), identifying the exhibits and
corresponding substitutes with the same exhibit number. Unless the court orders
othetwise, at the conclusion of the trial or evidentiary hearing at which the exhibits are
offered, if the clerk has custody of the substitutes, the clerk will return the
corresponding original exhibits to counsel. If an appeal is taken, substitutes will be
included in the record on appeal.
111. Disposal
The clerk may dispose of any unclaimed paper exhibits in accordance with
Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.430(±). Parties will bear all costs associated
with reclaiming exhibits.
17. Dismissal Docket
The clerk will prepare a dismissal docket for the respective Circuit Civil
Divisions in accordance with the applicable Rules of Civil Procedure.
18. Emergencies
A. Temporary Injunctions
Applications for temporary injunctions without notice must comply with Florida
Rule of Civil Procedure 1.610.
B. Emergency Matters in an Assigned Case
Application for emergency relief in an assigned case must be filed with the clerk
with the term "Emergency" in its title. When filing through the E-Portal, the moving
party must also indicate on the E-Portal interface's "Review and Submit" tab that the
document being filed is deemed an "Emergency Filing." A judge will review the
request as soon as reasonably possible.
i. Handling by a Judge Assigned to the Circuit Civil Division
The clerk will promptly notify and present the emergency matter to the presiding
judge of the division to which the case is assigned. If the clerk makes the notification
and presentation via e-mail, the clerk must verify that the judge is actually aware of the
pending emergency matter. If the judge of any division is for any reason absent from the
courthouse, any emergency application in any case assigned to that judge's division will
be presented by the clerk to the judge present in the courthouse whose Circuit Civil
Page 17 of 19 - Administrative Order S-2017-070 (Circuit Civil Division)
Division next follows in alphabetical sequence the division in which the case is
pending. The term "present in the courthouse" includes being in a hearing, a jury trial or
non-jury trial.
Any judge assigned to the Circuit Civil Division who issues an ex parte order
must personally conduct the return hearing unless the judge of the division in which the
case is pending agrees to conduct the hearing. All emergency motion handling orders
will be issued by the court, served on the parties, and delivered to the chambers of the
judge of the division in which the case is pending for any necessary follow-up action.
All emergency motion handling orders must be served to the parties by e-mail,
facsimile, or regular United States mail.
If the reviewing judge determines that an emergency does not exist or denies the
emergency request without a hearing, the requesting party is prohibited from presenting
the emergency request to any other judge except the judge presiding in the division to
which the case is assigned.
ii. Handling by Duty Judge
If there are no Circuit Civil Division judges present in the courthouse when an
application for emergency relief is made in an assigned case, then the emergency matter
will be presented to the duty judge. If the duty judge is a judge assigned to the Circuit
Civil Division, the judge will handle the matter in accordance with section 18.B.i. of
this administrative order above. If the duty judge is not assigned to the Circuit Civil
Division, then the duty judge will handle the matter as set forth below.
If a duty judge issues an ex parte order and determines that the nature of the
emergency requires that a return hearing be conducted imminently, the duty judge
will personally conduct the return hearing. If a duty judge issues an ex parte order
and determines that the nature of the emergency allows the return hearing to be
scheduled with the judge presiding in the division in which the case is pending, the
emergency motion and the ex parte order entered by the duty judge will be presented
to the judge presiding in the division to which the case is assigned. The judge
presiding in the division in which the case is pending may vacate any order issued by
the duty judge before, after, or in lieu of the return hearing.
If a duty judge determines that an emergency does not exist or denies the
emergency request without a hearing, the requesting party must not present the
emergency request to any other judge except the judge presiding in the division to
which the case is assigned.

C. Emergency Matters in an Unassigned Case
An unassigned case is a matter which has not been assigned to a Circuit Civil
Division because the clerk' s office is not and will not be open within a reasonable time.
Application for emergency relief in an unassigned case will be made to the chief judge
or the chief judge' s designee, if the chief judge is unavailable. Otherwise, the
application will be made to the duty judge. As soon as the clerk's office is open, any
application and any order entered will be filed and the clerk will assign the case in
accordance with section 2 of this administrative order.
